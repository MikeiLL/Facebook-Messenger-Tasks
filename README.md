## Facebook Messenger Tasks

Install fbchat and dotenv
`pip3 install python-dotenv fbchat`

Create a file named `.env` with your passwords:

```
JIM_EMAIL='facebookemail@yahoo.com'
JIM_PASS='mypassword'
```

Pretty simple stuff. Tested with python3.

Beware doing stuff like sending links or communicating to much too fast as they are 
vigilant in security to prevent spammers and scammers. I hear it.
